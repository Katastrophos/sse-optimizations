# SSE examples

**Note:** please, refer to [this blog post](http://shybovycha.github.io/2017/02/21/speeding-up-algorithms-with-sse.html) for details and explanations.

## Building

Just run `make`. You'll need Ruby *(any version)*, C++ and a processor, which supports SSE4 features.

## Running

Executables are put into `build/` directory. Run `./build/basics`, `./build/max` or `./build/sum`.
